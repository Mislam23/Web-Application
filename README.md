# Web-Application for To-Do list
Individual project developing a fullstack CRUD Web Application in the form of a To-Do List

<table><tr><td width="100%">
The to-do list allows a user to make a post request in the form of a todo. 
  
Then user is then given the option to edit and delete said todo.

**Disclaimer:**
Deployment to heroku was attempted, as evident in code's package.json file. However, a post request was met with a request timeout bug as current understanding allows. Which stops the post request from completeing and updating on the todo list board. This serves as a learning moment to further review heroku deployment bugs.
